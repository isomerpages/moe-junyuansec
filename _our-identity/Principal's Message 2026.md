<p>The Road Ahead - Journeying Forward with Purpose and Hope</p>
<p>At the end of 2025, we celebrated the graduation of our first cohort of
students who took the PSLE under the new Achievement Level (AL) scoring
system. The Class of 2025 had begun their secondary school journey during
the pandemic, navigating a rather challenging start with courage and resilience.
The cohort has gone on to make the school proud in many ways, growing from
strength to strength and leaving the school well prepared for the next
phase of their learning. This story reminds us that even rocky beginnings
can still end well. This is especially so when the students are supported
by a nurturing and enabling school environment that carefully balances
care and high expectations, nurturing students while challenging them to
be better persons for others.</p>
<p>As we begin 2026, we are cognisant that our students are growing up in
a world that is rapidly evolving, complex and often difficult to make sense
of. Education therefore must extend academic knowledge to equip them with
the skills and dispositions needed to navigate and embrace the opportunities
and challenges they will encounter. Even in the face of uncertainty, we
want our students to believe that they can shape their own path through
thoughtful effort, guided by hope for a better future. In this context,
the development of 21st Century Competencies has never been more critical.
Through our learning experiences, we encourage students to ask questions,
think critically and make informed judgements, ensuring that they remain
discerning learners in a world where technology provides instant answers
but may not always offer the most reliable or nuanced information.</p>
<p>Beyond academic learning, character remains central. Only with a strong
moral compass can students navigate differences and remain grounded in
challenging times. At Junyuan Secondary School, learning is always anchored
in values. As <em>Champions for the Community</em>, our students are reminded
that education is not only about personal success, but also about contributing
to the betterment of others. While student autonomy is important, it must
be exercised with responsibility and care for others. Even when perspectives
differ, we guide our students to act with respect, empathy and integrity.
Our CCE programmes encourage students to listen actively, collaborate effectively,
and act for the greater good. By translating values into action, our students
can strengthen both their character and their capacity to lead positively
within the school and the wider community.</p>
<p>We would like to thank our teachers for their professionalism and dedication,
our parents for their trust and partnership and our community partners
for their support. Together, we create a learning environment where students
grow not only in capability, but also in character and hope. For every
success story nurtured at Junyuan, we play a part in shaping a generation
that will contribute meaningfully to a more caring and hopeful future for
our nation.</p>
