<p><strong>2025 – Embracing a New Chapter of Growth</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Building on a Legacy of Excellence</strong>
</p>
<p>The past year was a momentous one for Junyuan Secondary as we celebrated
our 25th anniversary. This milestone provided a wonderful opportunity to
reflect on our rich history and to inspire our students to uphold our school's
values. As we celebrated our history, we made it a point to contribute
to the Tampines community through our food drive for the needy and inviting
primary school students to our Soiree concert. Our students enthusiastically
embraced these initiatives, demonstrating their commitment to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Renewing Our Mission: To Nurture and Empower Every Junyuan Champ to Learn, Lead and to Excel</strong>
</p>
<p>We had taken the past year to renew our mission to underscore our commitment
to fostering lifelong learning. ‘To Nurture and Empower Every Junyuan Champ
to Learn, Lead and to Excel’ now guides our every endeavour. We believe
that learning is an ongoing journey, and we are committed to providing
our students with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions they need to
thrive in an ever-changing world. Learning is not just about acquiring
knowledge; it's about developing empathy, understanding perspectives, and
cultivating the desire to become better persons for others. By fostering
this love of learning within our students, we empower them to become responsible
citizens who can navigate complex challenges and contribute meaningfully
to society.</p>
<p><strong>Learning from Our Past, Shaping Our Future</strong>
</p>
<p>2025 marks our nation’s 60th year of independence and we will celebrate
our nation-building journey and reflect on our shared values of multiculturalism
and resilience that have united us and allowed us to prosper against the
odds. Education has been an integral part of nurturing active and concerned
citizens who are responsible to their family, community and nation and
take active roles in improving the lives of others.</p>
<p>Throughout our 25-year journey, our vision has remained unwavering, to
empower students to become ‘Champions for the Community’. In the past year,
we witnessed firsthand the incredible determination exhibited by our students
when they were given the opportunity to serve others. Across school activities
to community projects, our students stepped up, showcasing their better
selves as they contributed meaningfully to their community. These experiences
not only benefited the community but also fostered personal growth and
a deeper understanding of how students can make a positive difference in
the world.</p>
<p><strong>Unlocking Learning Through Service</strong>
</p>
<p>If their sense of service and desire to make a difference drive our students
to become better versions of themselves, what can it unlock in their learning?
When students are intrinsically motivated by a desire to contribute positively
to their community, their learning transforms. They recognise that learning
is not merely a collection of facts, but a powerful tool for understanding
the world and making a difference. We will leverage this drive by presenting
students with real-world challenges and encouraging them to exercise their
critical thinking skills to develop innovative solutions. This approach
not only enhances their academic skills but also fosters a sense of self-direction
and ownership over their learning. As they explore their own passions and
pursue projects that align with their values, students become more invested
in their education and develop the skills and confidence to become lifelong
learners.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Forward to a Year of Growth and Discovery</strong>
</p>
<p>We are excited about the year ahead and the opportunities it presents
for our students to learn, grow, and make a positive impact on the world.
We encourage parents to actively engage in their child's education and
partner with us on this journey. May 2025 be successful and rewarding for
everyone at Junyuan Secondary.</p>
