<p>The letters &lsquo;J&rsquo; and &lsquo;Y&rsquo; nestling on a double S, symbolise the development and growth of the individual child in school, within the context of the community at large and the nation. Junyuan, which means in Mandarin, the SOURCE OF GOOD THINGS, is the place where the pupils are taught to be persons of character and to discover, strive and pursue the truth and the ideals of education. It is also the place where the pupils are nurtured by a supportive school community to develop their potential as they challenge themselves to greater heights. The pupils are constantly reminded that ultimately they have a role to play in society. Whilst the pupils are given opportunities to grow to be unique individuals, capable of independent thought and expression, they have a duty to be responsible citizens of the nation and the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">JUNYUAN A PLACE WE CAN TURN TO,<br />A PLACE THAT TEACHES RIGHT FROM WRONG.<br />IT&rsquo;S WHERE WE STUDY, WORK AND PLAY,<br />TO BE SKILLED IN EVERY WAY.<br />IT&rsquo;S WHERE WE STRIVE TO BE DISCIPLINED AND STRONG.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">JUNYUAN IS WHERE WE BUILD OUR DREAMS ON,<br />WHERE GOOD THINGS ARE BESTOWED ON US.<br />SO IN OUR FUTURE DEEDS AND TIMES,<br />IN ITS NAME WE SOUND THE CHIMES,<br />LET&rsquo;S PROCLAIM OUR HERITAGE WITH A STIRRING CHORUS.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">LET US PROCLAIM OUR WATCHWORDS TO ALL<br />WE ARE RESOLUTE, RIGHTEOUS, RESPONSIBLE.<br />OUR MOTTO WE SEEK TO UPHOLD, TO EXEMPLIFY AND SHOW,<br />JUNYUAN&rsquo;S EMBLEM WE WOULD HOIST TO SHOW THE WORLD.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>CHORUS</em><br />FOR JUNYUAN WE SHALL RAISE OUR CRY,<br />AND LONG SHALL OUR ENSIGN FLY;<br />OUR ALMA MATER WE SING THY PRAISE,<br />IN YOUR COLOURS WE SET THE TRAIL ABLAZE.</p>
