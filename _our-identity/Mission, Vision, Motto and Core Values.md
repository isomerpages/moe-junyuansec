<p><strong>Our Junyuan Story</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Junyuan Story began in 1999 when the school was founded. The two Chinese
characters “Jun” and “Yuan” represented by the letters J &amp; Y - mean
“Source of Good Things”. Nestling on a double S, the logo symbolises the
development and growth of the individual in a school, within the larger
context of the community and the nation. As a “Source of Good Things”,
we are committed to providing a holistic education that empowers students
to reach their full potential and be good citizens for the community and
the nation. We are guided by the following strategic thrusts:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Providing a student-centric academic curriculum to develop lifelong learners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Providing a value-centric character and citizenship curriculum to develop
compassionate leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing professional and competent staff who contribute to organisational
excellence</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By combining academic excellence with character development, we aim to
cultivate well-rounded students who can thrive in the 21st century. It
is our belief that when students see themselves as integral members of
the community, with the potential to positively impact the world, they
will be inherently motivated to develop their skills and capabilities.
Our dedicated staff plays a crucial role in this journey. They ensure that
learning is relevant and engaging, fostering adaptive thinkers, compassionate
leaders, and lifelong learners who live up to their potential as a "Source
of Good Things".</p>
