<p><strong>Strategic Thrust 1<br>Providing positive school experiences to develop persons for others</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Every opportunity, a meaningful learning experience<br>Every student, a community youth leader</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Thrust 2<br>Enabling keys to open many doors</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Every learning experience, a relevant bridge to the future<br>Every student, a confident &amp; future-ready / future-proof individual</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Thrust 3<br>Developing crew, not passengers</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Every student, a self-directed ambassador<br>Every staff, an innovative and competent mentor<br>Every adult, a positive role model</em>
</p>
<p>Junyuan Secondary School (JYSS) was established in January 1999. The two
Chinese characters “Jun” and “Yuan” mean Source of Good Things. To be the
“source of good things”, the school must propagate two key ideas about
learning. The first is that a school must provide positive learning experiences
so that the learners become better persons for others; the second is that
when these learners leave the school, they have the keys to open many doors
in life.</p>
<p>In Junyuan, these two ideas are encapsulated in our mission to nurture
and empower every Junyuan champ to lead, to serve, and to excel. Anchored
in the values of a servant-leader with a mindset of excellence, imbued
with the resilience and sense of responsibility to improve his community,
a Junyuanite is a team player who, through his positivity and respect for
others, inspires respect. If we achieve our mission, each of our student
would truly be a Champion for the Community.</p>
<p>Onboard the Junyuan ship, we aim to develop crew members, not merely passengers.
Crew members are committed to collaboratively sail the ship towards continuous
improvement, leveraging the spirit of innovation for the betterment of
the community. As crew members, we are mindful that for improvement to
be sustainable, we must achieve balance, much as how sailors keep their
ships on an even keel. In Junyuan, this balance is manifested in the following
community behaviours:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We develop team mastery and positive relationships, while valuing the
uniqueness of each individual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We understand when to appreciate and enable effective effort, and when
to appreciate stillness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We must nurture both resilience and adaptability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We dare to have many dreams, but we remain rooted in our core values and
our community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We ask many right questions, but we enjoy looking for the answers too</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We know how to engineer success, but we can also have fun while doing
so</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We achieve balance when we adopt the&nbsp;<strong>itinerary of sustainable improvement</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Consolidating the Right Things through ABCD –&nbsp;<strong>Affirming</strong>&nbsp;School
Progress &amp; Direction,&nbsp;<strong>Building Belief</strong>&nbsp;in
Systems, Structures and Process,&nbsp;<strong>Consolidating</strong>&nbsp;Core
Strategy-Programmes,&nbsp;<strong>Developing</strong>&nbsp;Personal Capacity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strengthening the Right Crew through EFGH –&nbsp;<strong>Enabling &amp; Enhancing</strong>&nbsp;Capacity<strong>, Fostering &amp; Growing</strong>&nbsp;Innovation,
Encouraging the&nbsp;<strong>Heart</strong>&nbsp;by increasing sense of
mission and belonging</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenging our Processes through the 3 Rs –&nbsp;<strong>Reviewing, Revisiting, Recrafting</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charting the Right Direction through IaM –&nbsp;<strong>Inspiring</strong>&nbsp;a
shared vision for the community and&nbsp;<strong>Modeling&nbsp;</strong>the
Way to get there</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To help us adopt this itinerary, we reduce effort inflation by asking
ourselves 6 essential questions:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>What and how are the students learning?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we know that they have learnt?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this necessary?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can the students do this on their own?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If not, how can we help them do it on their own?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What next?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
