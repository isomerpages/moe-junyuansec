<p><strong><u>CURRICULUM</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue Languages Department aims to develop confident and effective
communicators. Through the infusion of cultural and values education, we
aim to nurture students who appreciate their cultural heritage and are
able to connect with wider communities across Asia and the world.</p>
<p>The Mother Tongue Language curriculum focuses on listening, speaking,
reading, writing and interaction skills.</p>
<p>The Malay Literature curriculum aims to develop Reflective Readers and
Critical Learners through the ability to read, understand, and respond
critically to literary works while fostering interest in literature as
a Promoter of Asian Literary Heritage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also seeks to cultivate appreciation for the contributions of Malay
literature to cultural development as well as nurturing an independent
interest in reading a variety of literary works.</p>
<p><strong><u>ENRICHMENT</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong>
</p>
<p>At our school, MTL Fortnight is incorporated into the curriculum and organised
around annual themes. These themes shape a range of meaningful activities
that extend beyond learning in the classroom, such as calligraphy, drama,
traditional games, storytelling, and cultural performances.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of MTL Fortnight in Our School</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Immersive Learning:</strong> Provide students with opportunities
to engage in authentic, hands-on experiences that go beyond daily lessons,
allowing them to see the practical and creative use of their MTL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cultural Appreciation:</strong> Enable students to explore and
connect with cultural practices and traditions linked to their MTL, nurturing
respect for their heritage and that of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Promoting MTL:</strong> Spark students’ enthusiasm for learning
their MTL by presenting it in a fun, relevant, and meaningful contexts
that encourage continued use and interest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through this theme-based approach, MTL Fortnight enriches classroom learning,
deepens cultural understanding, and nurtures a genuine, lifelong passion
for Mother Tongue Languages.</p>
