<p><strong>Science Department @ Junyuan Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>At Junyuan Secondary School, the Science Department strives to nurture
every student into an <strong>inquisitive, innovative, and responsible learner</strong>.
Through our science curriculum, enriched with authentic experiences in
and beyond the classroom, we aim to spark curiosity, build confidence,
and prepare students for the challenges of the future.</p>
<p>Our teaching and learning approach is guided by the <strong>MOE Science Curriculum Framework</strong>,
which emphasizes <em>Knowledge, Understanding, Skills and Attitudes</em> in
science, and is anchored on the <strong>practices of science</strong>. Together
with the <strong>21st Century Competencies (21CC) framework</strong>, we
place a strong emphasis on developing <em>critical and inventive thinking, communication, collaboration, and information skills</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Goals &amp; Objectives</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Build a strong foundation in scientific concepts and skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultivate habits of mind, as well as the values, ethics, and attitudes
relevant to science, such as curiosity, creativity, resilience, integrity,
objectivity, and responsibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage in hands-on experiments and inquiry-based learning to make science
relevant to daily life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Lower Secondary Science (G1, G2, G3)</strong></h3>
<p>In the lower secondary years, students embark on an <strong>integrated science journey</strong> that
allows them to explore the key disciplines of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology
in meaningful ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways<br></strong> Students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learn to ask questions, investigate scientifically, and communicate their
findings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply critical thinking and collaborative problem-solving in real-world
contexts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a positive attitude towards science and confidence in their ability
to learn.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Upper Secondary Science (G1, G2, G3)</strong></h3>
<p>As students progress to upper secondary, they deepen their scientific
knowledge, strengthen their ability to apply science to authentic and complex
situations, and develop the values, ethics, and attitudes essential to
the practice of science. Students can choose different pathways based on
their strengths, interests, and aspirations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>G1 Science</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A broad-based science programme that builds practical and conceptual understanding
of the key scientific disciplines of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>G2 Science</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Subject combinations such as <em>Science (Chemistry)</em>, <em>Science (Biology)</em>,
and <em>Science (Physics)</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students gain deeper content mastery in two disciplines while continuing
to hone their inquiry and application skills. Helps students build a good
foundation for post-secondary education and STEM-related pathways</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>G3 Science</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pure Sciences: <em>Chemistry, Biology, Physics</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combined Sciences: <em>Science (Chemistry)</em>, <em>Science (Biology)</em>, <em>Science (Physics)</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students gain deeper content mastery in two disciplines while continuing
to hone their inquiry and application skills. Helps students build a good
foundation for post-secondary education and STEM-related pathways</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Takeaways</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Gain meaningful experiences</strong> in science, whether or not
they pursue it beyond secondary school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build strong foundations</strong> in understanding, skills, and
real-world applications of science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Develop future readiness</strong> by deepening interest in science,
staying curious, and becoming scientifically literate citizens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adopt a problem-solving mindset</strong> to analyse and solve challenges
across biology, chemistry, and physics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cultivate values and attitudes</strong> such as curiosity, creativity,
integrity, open-mindedness, resilience, responsibility, objectivity, and
healthy scepticism.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Beyond the Classroom</strong></h2>
<p>Learning in science goes far beyond textbooks and labs. At Junyuan, our
students engage in a wide range of <strong>enriching experiences</strong>,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning Journeys</strong> to institutes of higher learning, science
centres, and industry partners.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>National Science Competitions</strong> where students test their
creativity and innovation against peers across Singapore.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>School-based Projects and Inquiry Tasks</strong> that encourage
students to apply science in authentic, real-world contexts.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These experiences not only reinforce classroom learning but also nurture <strong>21CC skills</strong> such
as collaboration, inventive thinking, and effective communication.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<h2><strong>Our Vision for Every Junyuan ‘Scientist’</strong></h2>
<p>Through their science journey at Junyuan Secondary School, we hope every
student will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Stay Curious</strong> – exploring the wonders of the world with
an open and questioning mind.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think Creatively</strong> – applying scientific principles in innovative
and meaningful ways.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be Resilient</strong> – persevering through challenges and learning
from setbacks.
<br>
<br>
