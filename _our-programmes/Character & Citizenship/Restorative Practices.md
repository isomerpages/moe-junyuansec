<p><strong>Restorative Practices in Junyuan: Supporting Character Development and Socio-Emotional Growth</strong>
</p>
<p>In the teenage years, students go through rapid changes in their identity,
emotions, and relationships. Schools play a crucial role in guiding them
to grow not just academically, but also in character and socio-emotional
competencies. Restorative practices provide a framework that supports this
holistic development, helping students become responsible, confident, and
empathetic individuals.</p>
<p>Restorative practices focus on building, maintaining, and repairing relationships.
Aligned with MOE’s positive discipline approach, restorative approaches
emphasize dialogue, accountability, and reconciliation. This aligns closely
with the five socio-emotional competencies that students need for life:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-awareness</strong>: Through reflection during restorative
conversations, students learn to recognize their emotions, strengths, and
triggers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-management</strong>: By being guided to express feelings
appropriately and to consider consequences, students develop self-control
and resilience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Social awareness</strong>: Listening to others’ perspectives helps
teenagers cultivate empathy and appreciation for diversity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Relationship management</strong>: Working through conflicts respectfully
builds communication skills and trust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Responsible decision-making</strong>: Students learn to weigh
the impact of their actions on themselves and others, encouraging more
thoughtful choices in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Positive relationships are at the heart of restorative practices. When
teachers and students engage in open, respectful dialogue, it creates a
safe and supportive learning environment. Students feel heard, valued,
and connected, which boosts their confidence and sense of belonging. Similarly,
student-student relationships improve when conflicts are addressed constructively,
as peers learn to resolve disagreements without hostility. Over time, these
positive interactions nurture strong character traits such as respect,
responsibility, and empathy.</p>
<p>In moments of conflict or misbehavior, restorative practices guide students
to take responsibility and make amends. Instead of just focusing on consequences,
the school facilitates conversations where students reflect on what happened,
who was affected, and how to repair the harm. This process not only resolves
the immediate issue but also strengthens the community by restoring trust.
Students come away with practical lessons in accountability, problem-solving,
and reconciliation.</p>
<p>In essence, restorative practices support teenagers’ developmental needs
by combining structure with care, accountability with empathy. By focusing
on relationships, they provide students with the confidence and character
to navigate challenges, build resilience, and thrive both in school and
beyond.</p>
