<p><strong>(d) </strong><strong>Future readiness:&nbsp;</strong>Have a sense of purpose in life, develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning so as to be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and take on the challenges of the future, including the world of work.</p>
<p><strong>The CCE 2022 Curriculum Frame</strong></p>
<p>CCE curriculum content is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices. It comprises the learning of core values, social-emotional competencies and citizenship dispositions, with a focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students.</p>
<p><strong>CCE Curriculum content:</strong>&nbsp;The values, purpose, social-emotional competencies and three big ideas of identity, relationships and choice are woven across content areas of National Education (NE), Sexuality Education (SEd), Mental Health (MH), Education and Career Guidance (ECG), Cyber Wellness (CW), and Family Education (FE) in ways that are age-appropriate and meaningful for our students.</p>
<p><strong>Enactment of CCE Curriculum:</strong>&nbsp;CCE is enacted intentionally through learning platforms such as CCE lessons, key Student Development Experiences (SDEs), school-based initiatives, other subjects and opportunities for personal application.</p>
<p><strong>Caring and Enabling School Environment:</strong>&nbsp;A school environment that enables effective CCE is one with adult role-modelling, positive teacher-student relationships, peer support and relationships, student voice and ownership, and consistent and coherent messaging on CCE.</p>
<p>There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality. These include CCE lessons during curriculum time, Key Student development Experiences (SDEs) beyond the classroom, school-based initiatives, teachable moments during other subject lessons and learning opportunities beyond.</p>
<p>SDEs are programmes and activities that contribute towards the holistic development of our students in the physical, aesthetic, intellectual, moral and social domains. Key SDEs are programmes and activities that we provide and comprises of the following: Co-Curricular Activities (CCA), Cohort Learning journeys (LJs), Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Experiences, National Education (NE) Commemorative Days, NRIC Presentation Ceremony, Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) Cohort amps, Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programmes and Values in action (VIA).&nbsp;</p>
