<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Home-Based Learning (HBL) is a bi-weekly platform for students to learn
in settings beyond school through a blend of online and offline activities.
These activities complement in-school learning and are designed&nbsp;to&nbsp;develop
students' ability to be self-directed, passionate and lifelong learners.
These self-directed experiences will also encourage the development of
positive habits in learning, such as setting of learning goals and monitoring
of one’s learning progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HBL days will be conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year
to inculcate the practice of self-directed learning. We are confident that
with practice, every Junyuan student can continue their learning even when
they are at home.&nbsp;</p>
