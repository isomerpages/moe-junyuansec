<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>1.  Home-Based Learning (HBL) is a bi-weekly platform for students to learn in settings beyond school through a blend of online and offline activities. These activities complement in-school learning and are designed&nbsp;to&nbsp;develop students' ability to be self-directed, passionate and lifelong learners. These self-directed experience will also encourage the development<br /> of positive habits in learning, such as setting of learning goals and monitoring of one&rsquo;s<br /> learning progress.</p>
<p>2. HBL days will be conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year to inculcate the<br /> practice of self-directed learning. We are confident that with practice, every Junyuan<br /> student can continue their learning even when they are at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Schedule</strong></p>
<p>3. All Sec 1, 2 and 3 are scheduled for HBL in Semester 2 2022 on the following Fridays -<br /> 8 Jul, 22 Jul, 5 Aug, 19 Aug, 23 Sep 2022.</p>
<p>Note: Sec 1A, 1B and 1C will attend in-person lessons in school on 8 Jul 2022 and commence their HBL on 22 Jul 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Instructions to Students</strong></p>
<p>4. Subject teachers for English, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue will be assigning<br /> lessons and assignments to you based on the Friday timetable for&nbsp;<u>even</u>&nbsp;weeks. You can<br /> access the timetable here:&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. You are expected to take personal ownership by&nbsp;following the instructions provided in the<br />SLS assigned lessons, or in the email by your subject teachers. These instructions may<br />include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Learning tasks and assignments to complete using your textbooks/workbooks/pre-<br />distributed worksheets</li>
<li>Deadlines and modes for the submission of assignments</li>
<li>Duration needed to complete the learning tasks</li>
<li>Common times to log-on for collaborative or real-time lessons</li>
</ol>
<p>6. Seek assistance from your teachers if you are unable to locate the learning resources<br />during HBL. You can find their email addresses here:-</p>

<p>You can email the HOD of the relevant subject if you are unable to locate your subject teacher&rsquo;s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. You should access the following platforms for your learning resources:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Log-in to your account for the Student Learning Space (SLS) for your assigned lessons</li>
<li>Check your Student ICON email for specific instructions from your subject teachers&nbsp;</li>

<p>9. Practise good cyber habits by focusing on the tasks instead of surfing other sites or<br />checking social media. Do remember to take regular breaks so that the mind can<br />consolidate and make time to exercise and eat well.</p>
<p><strong>Student Initiated Learning (SIL) Activity (for Sec 1 and 3)</strong></p>
<p>10. Sec 1 and 3 students will also embark on Student Initiated Learning to work on a topic of<br />their interest, e.g. playing guitar, learning a new language. Students are given 1 hour during<br />each HBL day to plan their learning for this topic and curate online resources, e.g. YouTube<br />videos to support their learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Students will be briefed by their form teachers on the SIL in Term 3. Students can refer to<br />the following resource to get started:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><a href="/files/3.%20Secondary%20Student-Initiated%20Learning%20Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Secondary Student-Initiated Learning Guide</u></a></li>
<li><a href="/files/3a.%20Resource%20List%20for%20SIL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Resource List for SIL</u></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>12. Learning to manage your time is part of the intent of HBL so we encourage students to<br />spend at most 60 minutes on their SIL activity during HBL days. Enjoy your SIL activity but<br />do so safely.</p>
