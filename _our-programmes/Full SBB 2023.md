<p><strong>Common Curriculum Subjects</strong></p>
<p>In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level at lower secondary levels, namely Art, Character &amp; Citizenship Education, Design &amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music, and Physical Education. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>We welcome the&nbsp;Mixed Form Class in 2023:</strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Each Mixed Class bridges students from different courses. It offers more opportunities for students to interact with others taking different subject combinations; with different strengths and interests. Within the Mixed Class, students have more opportunities to learn from, interact with and bond with a more diverse group of peers, hence enriching their perspectives.</p>

<p><strong>Customised Learning for our Students:</strong></p>
<p>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOE's ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students. With Full SBB, we move towards a secondary school education where students learn each subject at the level that best caters to their overall strengths, interests and learning needs.</p>

<p><strong>Full subject-based banding allows students to learn according to their own pace:</strong></p>
<p>Under Full SBB, there will no longer be separate Express, N(A), and N(T) courses, and students will be in mixed form classes where they can interact with peers of different strengths and interests.</p>
<p>English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science will be offered at Express Level, N(A) Level, and N(T) Level. The criteria for taking these subjects at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One is based on students' PSLE AL Score for each subject. Students will be grouped in different classes based on their subject level for each subject.</p>
