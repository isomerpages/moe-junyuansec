<p><strong>Applied Learning Programme&nbsp; (ALP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides opportunities for students
to bridge the gap between academic knowledge acquired in the classroom
and its practical application in real-world scenarios. This objective is
achieved by fostering students' understanding of the relevance of curricular
knowledge, cultivating motivation, and instilling a sense of purpose in
their learning.</p>
<p>At Junyuan, our ALP curriculum is centred around the contextual theme
of Food, Innovation, Science, and Health (FISH).</p>
<p><strong><u>Curriculum&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Junyuan, our Lower Secondary curriculum fosters self-awareness and
empowers students to understand and investigate areas on how they can manage
their eating habits. Through the various subjects, they gain valuable knowledge
and practical skills on how they can work towards a balanced and healthier
diet for themselves and their families.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Food &amp; Consumer Education (FCE): </strong>Students dissect
the science of food, delve into the world of nutrients and mastering food
preparation techniques. The Secondary 1 students will conclude the year
with a mini-MasterChef.</p>
<p><strong>Geography</strong>: Students explore the fascinating journey of
rice cultivation and understand the importance of food sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Malay Language</strong>: Students delve into the cultural significance
of grains, enriching their understanding of rice as an important staple
in the various cultures.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Physical education (PE):</strong> Students learn about healthier
food options and making informed choices, then put their knowledge into
action through an Orienteering Challenge during their Secondary 2 Level
Camp.</p>
<p>All the skills and ideas learnt—ranging from understanding the science
of food and nutrients in Food &amp; Consumer Education, exploring sustainable
food practices in Geography, appreciating cultural significance of grains
in Malay Language, to making informed food choices in Physical Education—culminate
in the JY MasterChef Cook-off in Secondary Two, where students creatively
apply their knowledge and cooking skills in a fun, competitive setting.</p>
<p>In Upper Secondary, students build on their prior knowledge and delve
deeper into health and food science. They explore scientific principles
and practical applications in areas such as coffee making, cultural tea
appreciation, and sustainable foods—including mushroom cultivation and
alternative proteins. Students also gain exposure to Health and Food Science
Education and Career Guidance (ECG), helping them make informed decisions
about future learning pathways and careers. Through these experiences,
students develop critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills
while learning to make informed choices for healthier living and sustainable
practices.&nbsp;</p>
