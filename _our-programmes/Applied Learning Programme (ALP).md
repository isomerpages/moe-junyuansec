<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) intends to enable students to appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic arena and to develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and skills. The emphasis is on the application of knowledge and thinking skills, stretching the imagination and applying these to authentic settings in society and industries.</p>
<p>At Junyuan Secondary School, we hope to achieve the long-term goal of every student an innovator, who is future ready. The different needs of the various student segments are met via the two-tiered approach.</p>
<p><strong>Tier One &ndash; Lower Secondary</strong></p>
<p><u>Food Science Programme<br /></u>At Tier one, the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) offered at Lower Secondary levels in Junyuan Secondary integrates Food Science into the formal curriculum and extends students' learning in Food and Consumer Education classes. The teachers design all ALP curriculum components which covers introduction to food science, food chemistry (molecular gastronomy), food microbiology, food preservation and food processing. Students carry out hands-on activities on food-related investigation and learn science process skills in contextualised settings. Students will be equipped with food manipulation knowledge and given the opportunity to invent and demonstrate resourcefulness. Students also gain a broader perspective of integrated learning where skills are transferrable to future-oriented domains such as Molecular Gastronomy and Coffee Barista.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><u>JY Master Chef</u></p>
<p>At the end of the semester, there will be a level wide competition &lsquo;JY Master Chef&rsquo; (modified from the current popular TV series &lsquo;Master Chef&rsquo;). Students need to research and brainstorm for ideas before the actual competition day and use their skillsets learnt during FCE/ALP to have a &lsquo;cook-off&rsquo; session with a mystery box of ingredients.</p>

<p><u>Microbit Programming</u></p>
<p>Another component of the ALP Programme includes Basic Microbit programming which aims to teach Secondary two students programming skills to create solutions to solve real-life challenges. Students use their programming skills to work on a project throughout the semester aimed at improving real life situations through the framework of design and computational thinking.</p>
<h4><strong>Tier One &ndash; Upper Secondary</strong></h4>
<p><u>Science in Coffee Making &amp; Molecular Gastronomy</u></p>
<p>Our Secondary three Tier 1 programme focuses on the development of abilities, interest and talents based on student&rsquo;s choice. We provide more in-depth molecular gastronomy and coffee barista classes and offer students more insights, greater awareness, and exposure&nbsp;to the application of food science and technology to real world situations.</p>

<h4><strong>Tier Two &ndash; Lower &amp; Upper Secondary</strong></h4>
<p><u>Intermediate Barista Programme</u></p>
<p>Students who express further interest in food science will be provided with further opportunities in our Tier 2 programme, which enables students to demonstrate their skills and talents. We provide workshops which covers comprehensive intermediate barista and brewing skills for those wanting to deepen their knowledge (E.g. Barista Skills, Brewing, Sensory Skills and Roasting)</p>

<p><u>National Competitions</u></p>
<p>The Tier 2 programme also encompasses National Competitions that our students participate in. Through these competitions, students develop resilience in overcoming challenges, interpersonal and critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>~Nanyang Polytechnic-Swensen&rsquo;s Ice cream challenge~</p>
<p>The competition aims to teach students about food science through the making of ice cream. It also challenges the students to come up with innovative flavours in accordance to the given theme. The winning entries were chosen based on innovation, taste and presentation and the students had to make the ice cream on-site.</p>

<p>~Maker Faire Singapore~</p>
<p>In 2018, our school sent a team for the &lsquo;Maker Faire Singapore&rsquo; where our students were selected to exhibit their kitchen gadget, the &lsquo;Automatic Cupcake Toping Dispenser. By applying the knowledge learnt during their Microbit Programming lessons, our students designed, built and programmed the gadget to help make food preparation a breeze.</p>

<p><strong>~Eco Cook-off Challenge 2020~</strong></p>
<p>Our students develop a nutritionally balanced and eco-friendly meal for teens (those in the 13-19 years age range). Through this competition, they learnt the science behind various cooking techniques such as Sous Vide and Emulsification. Students also developed their entrepreneurial dare to innovate. Check out their dishes here:</p>
