<h4><strong>Lifelong Learning Programme: Community Youth Leadership</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Goal: Every student, a Community Youth Leader</strong></p>
<p>The Learning for Life Programme in Community Youth Leadership (CYL) supports the school’s vision of nurturing our students to be Champions for the Community. 
	
<br><br>We adopt the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership by James M. Kouzes and Barry Z Posner in developing our student leaders in Junyuan. All student leaders will be trained in the Student Leadership Challenge (TSLC) and will have the opportunity to practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model the Way</li>
<li>Inspire a Shared Vision</li>
<li>Challenge the Process</li>
<li>Enable Others to Act</li>
<li>Encourage the Heart</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Junyuan Leadership Development Roadmap</strong></p>
<i>Leadership is a continuous learning journey. </i>

<p>We believe leadership is not positional, and that every student has the potential within them to be a leader. We hope to nurture our student leaders to be concerned citizens and active contributors to the community.</p>

<h4><strong>Junyuan Student Leaders</strong></h4>

<i>Leadership development is also character development.</i>

<p><strong><b>1) The Student Council</b><br></strong>The Student Council aims to Lead, Serve and Inspire students to be Champions for our Community. 
	
Councilors organise a variety of projects and events within and outside of school. Trainings, workshops, learning journeys and VIA projects are some of the leadership experiences that our councilors will engage in to hone their leadership skills.</p>

<p><strong><b>2) Orientation Leaders</b><br></strong>
Orientation Leaders are a vibrant, energetic bunch of student leaders who volunteer to lead and guide incoming Secondary One students.
Not only do they facilitate their Secondary One groups during Orientation, they continue to engage them throughout Term One in conversations involving CCA, time management and peer support.

</p><p><strong><b>3)	Peer Support Leaders </b><br></strong>
Our Peer Support Leaders create and anchor a culture of care, whether in learning, in social interactions or in the digital space. With their good relations with peers within the class, they look out for students exhibiting signs of distress, listen to their problems and empathise with them. 
Trained with peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing skills, our Peer Support Leaders also organise termly bonding activities for their classes.

<h5><strong>Junyuan Student Leadership Opportunities </strong></h5>

<i>Leadership is everyone’s business.</i>

<p><strong><b>1)	Secondary One Service Learning &amp; Innovation (SLI) Exposure </b><br></strong>
All Secondary One students go through a Service Learning &amp; Innovation (SLI) workshop to equip themselves with the knowledge of service learning and the use of Innovation Protocol to understand their roles in helping the community and generating ideas for community projects. In giving back to the community, we partnered with Food Bank Singapore and enabled every Secondary One class to raise awareness on food insecurity and organise food donation drives in Junyuan Secondary.

<p><strong><b>2)	Secondary Two Class VIA Project </b><br></strong>
All Secondary Two students will plan and execute their very own Values in Action (VIA) project as a class. This platform aims to develop students as socially responsible citizens who contributes to the community. 
Some classes have chosen to raise awareness and appreciate our non-teaching staff who work tirelessly for the Junyuan community. Other classes have partnered with external organisations to support a good cause.

<p><strong><b>3)	Secondary Three Co-organising of School Events</b></strong><br>
All Secondary Three students have the opportunity to organise a school event with their schoolmates and teachers. This allows them to take ownership of the selected school event and practise their leadership skills. Some of these events include Graduation Day, Teachers Day, Hari Raya Celebrations, Racial Harmony, International Friendship Day and many more. </p>

<p><strong><b>4)	CHAMPs-initiated Projects</b></strong><br>

They can propose changes, provide suggestions and lead in their very own student-initiated project. Some successful projects include Ofobrella (JY umbrella rental system), Class Calendar Whiteboards, Anti-Bacteria Hygiene Awareness Campaign, delivery rider appreciation, JY Charity Garden and Project MYRMEX.
