<h4><strong>Lifelong Learning Programme: Community Youth Leadership</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Goal: Every student, a Community Youth Leader</strong></p>
<p>The Learning for Life Programme in Community Youth Leadership (CYL) supports the school’s vision of nurturing our students to be Champions for the Community. 
<br><br>We adopt the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership by James M. Kouzes and Barry Z Posner in developing our student leaders in Junyuan. All student leaders will be trained in the Student Leadership Challenge (TSLC) and will have the opportunity to practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model the Way</li>
<li>Inspire a Shared Vision</li>
<li>Challenge the Process</li>
<li>Enable Others to Act</li>
<li>Encourage the Heart</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Junyuan Leadership Development Roadmap</strong></p>
*Leadership is a continuous learning journey.*

<p>We believe leadership is not positional, and that every student has the potential within them to be a leader. We hope to nurture our student leaders to be concerned citizens and active contributors to the community.</p>

<p><strong>Student Council<br></strong>The Student Council aims to Lead, Serve and Inspire students to be Champions for our Community. To achieve that, the Student Council organises a variety of projects and events within and outside of school.

<h4><strong>Service Learning &amp; Innovation (SLI) Exposure for Secondary One</strong></h4>
<p>The SLI Exposure consists of a workshop and experience volunteering at an external organisation. The workshop aims to equip students with the knowledge of service learning and the use of Innovation Protocol to understand their roles in helping the community and generating ideas for community projects. Through the workshop, students work in groups to generate innovative solutions to solve problems for the community. As part of the exposure,&nbsp;our Secondary 1 cohort had a hands-on experience in using the design thinking process to solve the problem of food insecurity in Singapore. In giving back to the community, they partnered with Food Bank Singapore and enabled every Secondary One class to organise a food donation drive in Junyuan Secondary.</p>

<h4><strong>Values in Action Project for Secondary Two</strong></h4>
<p>Students will be engaged as a class to plan and execute a Values in Action (VIA) project with external organisations. The project aims to develop students into socially responsible citizens meaningfully to the community through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills acquired in Secondary 1 SLI Exposure. As part of their learning, students also conduct a Community Cause Awareness Campaign to share about their project and learning from the experiences.</p>
<h4><strong>Co-Organising of School Events for Secondary Three</strong></h4>
<p>Student leaders will work together with various teachers, schoolmates and external organisations to execute a selected school wide event. Through this platform, student leaders take ownership of the event and grow from the experience of running large scale events. Some of these events include Graduation Day, Teachers Day, Hari Raya Celebrations, Racial Harmony, International Friendship Day and many more.&nbsp;</p>
