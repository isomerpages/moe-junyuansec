<h4><strong>Lifelong Learning Programme: Community Youth Leadership</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Goal: Every student, a Community Youth Leader</strong></p>
<p>The Learning for Life Programme in Community Youth Leadership (CYL) supports the school’s vision of nurturing our students to be Champions for the Community. 
<br><br>We adopt the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership by James M. Kouzes and Barry Z Posner in developing our student leaders in Junyuan. All student leaders will be trained in the Student Leadership Challenge (TSLC) and will have the opportunity to practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model the Way</li>
<li>Inspire a Shared Vision</li>
<li>Challenge the Process</li>
<li>Enable Others to Act</li>
<li>Encourage the Heart</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Junyuan Leadership Development Roadmap</strong></p>
*Leadership is a continuous learning journey.*

<p>We believe leadership is not positional, and that every student has the potential within them to be a leader. We hope to nurture our student leaders to be concerned citizens and active contributors to the community.</p>

<p><strong><b>2) Orientation Leaders</b><br></strong>
Orientation Leaders are a vibrant, energetic bunch of student leaders who volunteer to lead and guide incoming Secondary One students.
Not only do they facilitate their Secondary One groups during Orientation, they continue to engage them throughout Term One in conversations involving CCA, time management and peer support.

</p><p><strong><b>3)	Peer Support Leaders </b><br></strong>
Our Peer Support Leaders create and anchor a culture of care, whether in learning, in social interactions or in the digital space. With their good relations with peers within the class, they look out for students exhibiting signs of distress, listen to their problems and empathise with them. 
Trained with peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing skills, our Peer Support Leaders also organise termly bonding activities for their classes.

<h5><strong>Junyuan Student Leadership Opportunities </strong></h5>

<i>Leadership is everyone’s business.</i>

<p></p><p><strong><b>1)	Secondary One Service Learning &amp; Innovation (SLI) Exposure </b><br></strong>
All Secondary One students go through a Service Learning &amp; Innovation (SLI) workshop to equip themselves with the knowledge of service learning and the use of Innovation Protocol to understand their roles in helping the community and generating ideas for community projects. In giving back to the community, we partnered with Food Bank Singapore and enabled every Secondary One class to raise awareness on food insecurity and organise food donation drives in Junyuan Secondary.
