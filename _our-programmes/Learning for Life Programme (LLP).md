<h4><strong>Lifelong Learning Programme: Community Youth Leadership</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Goal: Every student, a Community Youth Leader</strong>
</p>
<p>The Learning for Life Programme in Community Youth Leadership (CYL) supports
the school’s vision of nurturing our students to be Champions for the Community.
<br>
<br>We adopt the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership by James M. Kouzes
and Barry Z Posner in developing our student leaders in Junyuan. All student
leaders will be trained in the Student Leadership Challenge (TSLC) and
will have the opportunity to practice:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Model the Way</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inspire a Shared Vision</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Challenge the Process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable Others to Act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage the Heart</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our Junyuan Leadership Development Roadmap</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Leadership is a continuous learning journey.</em>
</p>
<p>We believe leadership is not positional, and that every student has the
potential within them to be a leader. We hope to nurture our student leaders
to be concerned citizens and active contributors to the community.</p>

<h4><strong>Junyuan Student Leaders</strong></h4>
<p><em>Leadership development is also character development.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>1) The Student Council<br></strong>The Student Council aims to
Lead, Serve and Inspire students to be Champions for our Community.</p>
<p>Councilors organise a variety of projects and events within and outside
of school. Trainings, workshops, learning journeys and VIA projects are

<p><strong>2) Orientation Leaders<br></strong>Orientation Leaders are a vibrant,
energetic bunch of student leaders who volunteer to lead and guide incoming
Secondary One students. Not only do they facilitate their Secondary One
groups during Orientation, they continue to engage them throughout Term
One in conversations involving CCA, time management and peer support.</p>

<p><strong>3) Peer Support Leaders <br></strong>At Junyuan Secondary, our
Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) are at the heart of building a culture of care
and connection. Guided by their mission <em>to promote mental well-being and a sense of belonging</em>,
PSLs take the lead in creating safe, supportive and uplifting spaces for
all students.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, PSLs spearhead meaningful initiatives that bring
our community together:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Power Up! Class Bonding Games</strong>: energising classmates
with fun, engaging games that strengthen friendships and unity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caught in the Good Act</strong>: recognising and affirming everyday
acts of kindness, respect and responsibility among peers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attitude for Gratitude</strong>: developing a sense of gratitude
through class activities and habit building</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>International Friendship Day</strong>: celebrating diversity and
cross-cultural understanding through engaging the school with an interactive
game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Project WeCare</strong>: showing appreciation for non-teaching
staff and reminding everyone that care and gratitude go a long way.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These initiatives help to shape a culture where everyone feels valued,
supported, and empowered to thrive.</p>
<p>Our PSLs aspire to be <strong>Adaptable Leaders</strong>, <strong>Confident Communicators</strong>,
and <strong>Empathetic Peer Supporters, </strong>and go through training
to hone their leadership and facilitation skills. They lead by example
and exemplify the importance of&nbsp; looking out for one another and extending
a helping hand, so that every Junyuanite can be a peer supporter.</p>

<h5><strong>Junyuan Student Leadership Opportunities</strong></h5>
<p><em>Leadership is everyone’s business.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>1) Secondary One Service Learning &amp; Innovation (SLI) Exposure <br></strong>All
Secondary One students go through a Service Learning &amp; Innovation (SLI)
workshop to equip themselves with the knowledge of service learning and
the use of Innovation Protocol to understand their roles in helping the
community and generating ideas for community projects. In giving back to
the community, we partnered with Food Bank Singapore and enabled every
Secondary One class to raise awareness on food insecurity and organise
food donation drives in Junyuan Secondary.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="LLPimage45" src="/images/llpimage45.JPG">
</div>
<p><strong>2) Secondary Two Class VIA Project <br></strong>All Secondary
Two students will plan and execute their very own Values in Action (VIA)
project as a class. This platform aims to develop students as socially
responsible citizens who contributes to the community. Some classes have
chosen to raise awareness and appreciate our non-teaching staff who work
tirelessly for the Junyuan community. Other classes have partnered with
external organisations to support a good cause.</p>

<p><strong>3) Secondary Three Co-organising of School Events</strong>
<br>All Secondary Three students have the opportunity to organise a school
event with their schoolmates and teachers. This allows them to take ownership
of the selected school event and practise their leadership skills. Some
of these events include Graduation Day, Teachers Day, Hari Raya Celebrations,
Racial Harmony, International Friendship Day and many more.</p>

<p><strong>4) CHAMPs-initiated Projects</strong>
<br>As part of student advocacy, all students are welcomed to initiate projects
that aim to improve the school environment, community, or kick start new
initiatives for a good cause. They can propose changes, provide suggestions
and lead in their very own student-initiated project. Some successful projects
include Ofobrella (JY umbrella rental system), Class Calendar Whiteboards,
Anti-Bacteria Hygiene Awareness Campaign, delivery rider appreciation,
JY Charity Garden and Project MYRMEX.</p>
