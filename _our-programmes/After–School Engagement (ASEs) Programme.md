<p><strong>After- School Engagement (ASEs)&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>GEAR UP Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>GEAR-UP (Guiding &amp; Empowering Students for Affiliation &amp; Resilience to Unlock their Potential)</strong> Programme
is a school-based integrated support designed to enhance students’ learning
motivation, strengthen their connection to school, and build their resilience.
It serves as a proactive approach to engage students meaningfully after
school, offering them a safe, supportive and structured environment to
develop both socially and emotionally.</p>
<p>The programme aims to <strong>encourage regular school attendance</strong> by
providing students with positive reasons to stay engaged in school life
beyond academic lessons. By participating in activities that they find
enjoyable and purposeful, students experience school as a place where they
are valued, accepted, and supported. This sense of belonging and connection
to the school community is an important <strong>protective factor</strong> against
absenteeism and disengagement. When students feel emotionally connected
to their peers and teachers, they are more likely to attend school regularly
and participate actively in the school experience.</p>
<p>The GEAR UP Programme comprises a range of <strong>after-school engagement activities</strong> tailored
to students’ interests and developmental needs. These include sports such
as soccer, creative workshops like baking and handicrafts, and skill-based
sessions such as barista training. Each activity is thoughtfully designed
not only to provide enjoyment but also to nurture important life skills
such as teamwork, communication, responsibility, and perseverance. By participating
in such programmes, students learn to manage their time meaningfully, using
their unstructured hours productively while discovering personal interests
and strengths that may not surface in a typical classroom setting.</p>
<p>Beyond skills acquisition, GEAR UP is intentional in developing students’ <strong>social-emotional competencies (SE competencies)</strong> —
including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship
management, and responsible decision-making. For instance, students learn
to work collaboratively with peers from different backgrounds, respect
differing opinions, and build positive friendships. They also develop resilience
through overcoming challenges in activities, learning to persist despite
setbacks. These experiences help students better understand themselves
and others, manage emotions, and make responsible choices — skills that
are essential for success both in school and in life.</p>
<p>The relationships formed through the GEAR UP Programme are another key
pillar of its success. Through shared experiences, students develop meaningful
bonds with peers who share common interests and with teachers who guide
them in a mentoring capacity. These positive relationships foster a sense
of belonging and trust, reinforcing a <strong>supportive school culture</strong> where
students feel seen, heard, and encouraged to grow. As students gain confidence
and social connectedness, they begin to take greater ownership of their
actions, displaying qualities such as empathy, respect, responsibility,
and resilience.</p>
<p>The GEAR UP Programme goes beyond engagement — it nurtures the whole child.
By combining enjoyable activities with intentional character and socio-emotional
development, the programme helps students discover their strengths, build
resilience, and develop the confidence to unlock their full potential.
Through GEAR UP, students are guided and empowered to become self-directed
learners and positive contributors to the school community.</p>
