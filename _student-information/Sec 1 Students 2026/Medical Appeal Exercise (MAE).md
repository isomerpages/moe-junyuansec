<p>The MAE only applies to students with serious medical conditions. Parents
are required to produce any documentary evidence or the reason for transfer
listed below:
<br>
<br>a. Serious Medical Conditions. Students with persistent or serious illness
e.g. chronic heart conditions, kidney problems. An official letter or medical
report from a certified doctor must be attached to the application.
<br>
<br>b. Severe Physical Impairments. Students with physical impairments, such
as those requiring permanent use of a wheelchair. An assessment from qualified
medical professional(s) of the student’s conditions and needs should be
submitted. The assessment should clearly describe the extent of impairments
(temporary/permanent) and the type of assistive device that the student
is currently using (e.g. use of a wheelchair).
<br>
<br>Parents can file your appeals at the posted school in person by 12pm,
22 December 2025. Parents also have the alternative option of submitting
their MAE application request to their posted secondary school via email
at <a href="mailto:junyuan_ss@moe.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">junyuan_ss@moe.edu.sg</a>.
Each student is only allowed to submit one application.
<br>
<br>Parents are reminded that school transfer under MAE is subject to availability
of vacancies. Successful applicants<strong> <u>will not</u></strong> be
allowed to reject the posted school and request to be admitted back to
their original posted school.</p>
