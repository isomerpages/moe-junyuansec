<p><strong>Class Allocation and Timetable</strong>
</p>
<p>Come 2026 we welcome our Sec 1s to the Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB).

strengths and interests.</p>
<p>You will be able to check your child's class allocation here <a href="https://script.google.com/a/macros/moe.edu.sg/s/AKfycbw9w5VZx_qGt0siQyJgPZvTP0BjXL2vXW5_WKhseUENR5a0O3RuMZaeQgjMk6Vi23Ubxw/exec" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><u>here </u></a>from
