<p>Sec 1 students who are posted to the N(A) and N(T) courses may be offered EL/Math/Science/MTL at a higher level, based on their PSLE subject grades.&nbsp;Eligible N(A) and N(T) students will receive the letter of offer from the posted secondary school. Student can choose to take or reject the offer. They are to complete the form to indicate the subjects he/she wishes to take (or not to take) at the higher level and submit the completed form to the&nbsp;<strong>General Office / via Email&nbsp;</strong>by&nbsp;<strong>28 Dec 2021</strong>. </p>
<p>Taking subjects at a higher academic level can help students nurture their strengths and give them more opportunities throughout their educational journey, so that they are more engaged in learning.&nbsp;Previously, students in N(A) and N(T) courses can take higher-level subjects starting from Secondary 3. With SBB, your child can start doing so from the start of Secondary 1, to build a stronger foundation in their stronger subjects.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;each student should take&nbsp;<strong><u>no more</u></strong>&nbsp;than 3 higher level subjects so as to ensure that he/she can cope with the overall academic demands.</p>
