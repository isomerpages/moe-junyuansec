<p>Eligibility Criteria for HMTL at S1
<br>From 2026 S1 onwards, eligible students may offer HMTL instead of MTL
should they meet the following criteria.
<br>* PSLE MTL score of AL1/AL2; or
<br>* HMTL score of Distinction/Merit
<br>
<br>These are the designated HMTL centres nearest to Junyuan Secondary.
<br>Higher Tamil Language Centre : Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School (Lesson

<br>
<br>Application to be exempted from taking MTL
<br>MTL exemption may only be considered if the student:
<br>(a) has been away from Singapore school system for some years or joins
our school system mid-stream without prior learning of our official MTL
or MTL-in-lieu
<br>(b) has certified Special Educational Needs (SEN) and shows severe difficulty
in coping with their overall learning
<br>
<br>Students who are already exempted from taking MTL at primary school level
will continue the exemption. There is no need to re-apply the exemption
at Sec One. Students will remain in class to do self-study during MT lessons.
<br>
<br>Taking Asian/Foreign Language as MTL-in-lieu (not as Third Language)
<br>For students taking Asian/Foreign languages in lieu of MTL at primary
school, he / she has to continue taking Asian/Foreign languages at Sec
One. There is no need to submit a re-application for Sec One students who
have obtained approval at the primary school level to offer Asian/Foreign
Language. Students are required to continue to learn the language privately
and ensure that the private education provider can prepare the students
for the SEC examinations.</p>
