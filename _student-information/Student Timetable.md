<p><strong><u>Student Timetable for Semester 2 (2022)</u></strong></p>
<p>We have moved into a 2 week (odd and even) timetable for Semester 2, in order to factor in the Blended Learning Day on every even week Friday for Secondary 1 to Secondary 3 students. As such you will have 2 timetable per class, an odd week as well as an even week timetable. The timetable to refer to when school reopens on Mon 27 Jun is the odd week timetable.</p>
<p>Secondary 4 / 5 students will no longer have Blended Learning in Semester 2. All Sec 4/5 students will return to school for lessons (Monday to Friday for all weeks) in Semester 2.</p>
