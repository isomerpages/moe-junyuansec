<h4>JYSS 25th Anniversary</h4>
<p>“Riding the Next Wave: Building Resilience, Growing Excellence”. Our current
successes would not have been possible without the work and dedication
of our past Junyuanites. It is with the support of all, past and present
that we can ride the next wave, and look forward with fortitude. Thank
you to our School Advisory Committee, Parents and Alumni for their generous
contributions and heartfelt support, for our Anniversary Walk on 7 March,
Bedok Reservoir.</p>
