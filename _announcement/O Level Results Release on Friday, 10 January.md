<p>Dear students and parents,</p>
<p>The O Level Results release will be on Friday 10 January 2025. Students
are to report to the School Hall at 2.30pm for the post-results release
briefing and collection of results slip and certificates. Students are
required to be in proper school attire (school uniform or PE t-shirt with
pants or skirt) and appropriate hairstyle. We seek your understanding that
students who are not in acceptable attire and grooming would be requested
to attend the briefing in a separate venue.</p>
<p>For student who are unwell or unable to collect the results, they are
advised to appoint a proxy to collect their results from the school.</p>
<p>Parents / guardians (maximum 2) can accompany their child/ward to school
