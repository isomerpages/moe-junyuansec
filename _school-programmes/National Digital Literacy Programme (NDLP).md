<p>At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National
Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher
Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the
components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every
secondary school student will own a school-prescribed computing device
or Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. Below are some important
information about how you can purchase the PLD for your child/ward as well
as about the accompanying applications that the school will be rolling
out as part of the NDLP.</p>
<p>The Personal Learning Device (PLD) will be used in tandem with the national
elearning platform - the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) - as well
as other educational technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning.
This will also better enable students to acquire digital skills and apply
these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world.</p>
