<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Home-Based Learning (HBL) is a platform for students to learn in settings
beyond school through a blend of online and offline activities. These activities
complement in-school learning and are designed&nbsp;to&nbsp;develop students'
ability to be self-directed, passionate and lifelong learners. These self-directed
experiences will also encourage the development of positive habits in learning,
such as setting of learning goals and monitoring of one’s learning progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HBL days will be conducted on a regular basis throughout the school year
to inculcate the practice of self-directed learning. We are confident that
with practice, every Junyuan student can continue their learning even when
they are at home.&nbsp;</p>
