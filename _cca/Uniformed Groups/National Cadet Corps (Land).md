<p>I am truly grateful to be a part of NCC at my school because it has helped
me grow both as a student and as a person. Being in NCC has taught me discipline,
responsibility, and the importance of teamwork. Through drills, activities,
and camps, I have learned to stay confident, focused, and respectful while
working with others. NCC has also given me a sense of pride and belonging,
motivating me to serve my school and community with dedication. I am thankful
for the opportunities and values NCC has given me, and I feel proud to
be a member of it.

<p>I am glad that I chose NCC as my CCA during my secondary school journey.
Over the years, NCC has helped me grow and step out of my comfort zone.
Being given the role of Sec 1 Overall IC allowed me to gain more confidence
and learn how to lead others better, even in a setting where I had to push
myself further. Through the challenges and trainings, I became more independent
and learnt to stay strong even when things were difficult. I am thankful
for my peers who supported me throughout this journey and made NCC more
meaningful. If I were to go back to Secondary One, I would still choose
NCC without hesitation.

<p>I am truly blessed and thankful to be a member of NCC. This CCA has provided
me with many Throughout my NCC journey so far, I have learned how to handle
responsibilities better while having fun at the same time. NCC trainings
were sometimes tough, but they were also exciting and enjoyable. I liked
taking part in different activities with my friends and learning new skills.
As I was given more responsibilities, I learned to be more disciplined
and to take my role seriously. Even when training was tiring, I did not
give up and tried my best. NCC has taught me the importance of hard work,
teamwork, and responsibility. Overall, my NCC experience has been fun,
exciting, and meaningful.</p>
