<p>“NCC has taught me on resilience. I persevere in face of challenges and it definitely feels great with what I have achieved at the end of the training.”<br><strong>– Syakirah (4E3, 2021)</strong></p>
<p>“NCC has given me numerous opportunities to step up and lead. I get to display values such self-discipline and initiative. NCC has also brought me closer to my fellow cadets, who slowly turned into my close friends today. Despite challenging trainings, it is encouraging and motivating when you realise that the motto, “Leave No Man Behind,” is actually what NCC is all about. No matter the challenge, nor the duration, we will always cross the finish line together!”<br><strong>– Irdina (4E4, 2021)</strong></p>
