<p>“I am very happy and fortunate to have chosen NCC as my CCA. NCC is more
than just about the Army. There are many activities offered such as HQ
camps, air rifle shooting, competitions and fun courses. Through NCC, I
have gained values such as teamwork, courage and responsibility. As the
USM of my CCA, it also gave me a chance to lead and change myself to become
a better person physically and mentally.”
<br><strong>– MSG Abdul Ra’uf</strong>
</p>
<p>“I am grateful to be a part of Junyuan NCC during my secondary school
years. NCC has taught me useful values and skills which includes responsibility,
discipline, and confidence. I am also fortunate to have fellow cadets who
have supported me in the CCA. After being appointed as the ASM of the CCA,
I started to learn more things and grow as a leader. I have stepped out
of my comfort zone to lead the unit and worked as a team player to achieve
a common goal.”
<br><strong>- MSG Ahmad Syakir</strong>
</p>
<p>I am truly blessed and thankful to be a member of NCC. This CCA has provided
me with many enriching experiences such as going on camps, leadership courses
as well as the opportunity of live firing. These activities helped to teach
and instill values such as resilience, responsibility and adaptability
in me, allowing me to lead my CCA more effectively and become a better
individual overall.</p>
<p>–<strong> MSG Ian Chan</strong>
</p>
<p>I am very grateful to be part of NCC. This CCA has impacted my life in
many ways and offered me many benefits which would help me in my future
path. I learnt skills such as the ability to lead, think outside of the
box and adapt to harsh environments both mentally and physically.&nbsp;
I am also very fortunate to have many friends in Junyuan NCC as well as
from other school units. I feel that through the failures and successes
I experience, I have evolved and grown together with my fellow cadets as
a team. As the Assistant Sergeant Major, i would like to say It has been
an honour to serve as a National Cadet Corp cadet in Junyuan Secondary
School as it has given me an unbreakable positive mindset, bonds to treasure,
and through time, nurtured me to excel.</p>
<p><strong>– MSG Muhd Arsyad</strong>
</p>
<p>I am very thankful for choosing NCC as my CCA during my secondary school
journey. People might think that NCC is just drills like marching and standing
in the sun for a long time but throughout the years in NCC, I have learnt
that NCC is more than that. NCC has taught me important life principles
such as responsibility, commitment and loyalty. As the Sec 2 Overall IC,
I have grown to be an adaptive leader and am looking forward to more opportunities
for me to lead and serve the CCA. NCC has also allowed me to experience
fun and adventure while bonding with my fellow cadets. One of the most
memorable experience I had this year was to participate in an overseas
expedition to Mount Ophir. That expedition had taught me on patience and
how to overcome challenges.</p>
