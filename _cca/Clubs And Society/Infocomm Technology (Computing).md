<h4><strong>Our Purpose:</strong></h4>
<p>Infocomm Technology members have the opportunity to hone their specialized technological skills. Following the ICM Learning Roadmap, students with a keen interest in technology can explore various functional domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Game Development and Cybersecurity. IMDA provides support for a variety of training courses to help Infocomm Technology members enhance their knowledge and proficiency in these specific functional domains.</p>
<h4><strong>Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) – LEARN Roadmap:</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Game Development: </strong>Students will gain an understanding of concepts such as game mechanics and storytelling. Students will also learn how to create a game design document, storyboard, create game environments, customise nonplayable characters (NPCs) as well as add randomisation, music and sounds into their games.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong>Students will gain an understanding of Machine Learning and AI concepts and work on applying these concepts through a project. Ethical and privacy issues relating to AI will also be discussed. The project work will include a simple machine learning model and computer vision.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong>Students will gain an understanding of cybersecurity and cyberthreats in the gaming industry and how to safeguard personal data in a game from cyberattacks.</li>
</ul>
