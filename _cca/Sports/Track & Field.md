<p><strong>Our Journey</strong></p>
<img style="width: 80%;" src="/images/tnf.jpg">
<p>"<em>We are not only looking for talented youths, but those who have the passion for running as well as to keep fit in general</em>." - Mr Elkan Lam (Teacher IC)</p>
<p>"<em>You may not be the fastest runner in the world, but you can be the fastest you can be. So break your personal bests</em>!" - Ms Suhailah (Teacher IC)</p>
<p>"<em>My CCA’s focus is to impart love of exercise and running; build a resilient athlete with respect for sportsmanship. My CCA is a sport which includes athletic contests established on the skills of running, jumping, and throwing. My CCA is not just about speed during training. It is more of our attitude and discipline. In my CCA I learnt that regular practice and self discipline is important, without which I cannot progress much in my skills. When I first joined my CCA I was really nervous and clueless as it was my first time joining track &amp; field. After a few months of training and with the guidance of my senior, I felt welcomed and encouraged to do well for my CCA. Although there were many ups and downs I managed to remain focused and determined to do well. Therefore I am really proud to be part of the track team</em>." - Batrisyia Fatini ( Ex-Captain) - 4N2, 2021</p>
<p>"<em>The thing that I enjoy about my CCA is that we could run freely in the wind. At times, we could play games together as a team which allows us to work together as a team</em>." - Mohammed Fadhil (Ex-Captain)</p>
<p>"<em>Track &amp; Field has shaped me to the person I am now. Being in the CCA throughout my secondary school life, I had learnt perseverance, to never give up when a challenge comes in my way. The CCA helped me develop my inner self, making me confident &amp; more self-conscious. All these made me a better person, for myself and for the community.</em>" - Aniq (Ex-Captain)</p>
<p>“<em>Keep going, don’t give up so easily there’s always a way to solve a puzzle.</em>” - Nurin ( Captain ) - 3T1</p>
<p>“<em>The will to win is important, but the will to prepare is vital</em>.” - Zenon ( Vice Captain ) - 3E2</p>
<p>“<em>Once you’ve reached rock bottom, it’s your choice to stay down or get back up</em>. “ - Arfan ( Vice Captain ) - 3N1</p>
<p>“<em>It’s okay to fall, just get back up and try again</em>.” - Emilia ( Captain ) - 3E1</p>
