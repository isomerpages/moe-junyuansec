<p>“My experience in JY volleyball has been incredibly rewarding. From learning
the fundamental and teamwork skills of volleyball, I’ve also learned valuable
skills such as effective communication with my teammates on court, discipline,
and perseverance. These skills have changed my attitude and mindset, which
are beneficial in both on court training and other areas of life.</p>
<p>If you’re new to volleyball, you should definitely give it a try! I was
also new to volleyball when I first joined the CCA and I found it very
engaging. It can help you to develop self-confidence while learning volleyball,
teamwork and mindset skills. Plus, it’s a great way to create new friendships
among your teammates and long-lasting memories⭐️!!” <em>– Nur Sabrina4A, Upper Sec Captain 2026.</em>

<p>“I chose to join volleyball to challenge myself, expose myself to different
things and to build new friendships through it. During the CCA trials,
I was drawn to volleyball's fast-paced and dynamic nature, and also the
team's welcoming atmosphere. Volleyball in Junyuan has changed me, not
just physically, but also mentally and emotionally. I've learnt many skills
such as serving, setting, receiving and spiking. More importantly, I've
learnt discipline and perseverance through every training, changing my
perspective of volleyball. My favourite thing about training is the bonding
with my teammates. Overcoming challenges and achieving small victories
together increases our team spirit and teamwork together. It is not about
winning, but it is about encouraging one another by cheering saying "it's
okay" and "you can do it!". This CCA has really made an impact on my life
as it made me realise how important having confidence in yourself was.</p>
<p>Volleyball is a fun, dynamic and social sport which anyone can try out!
It enhances our mental toughness as we grow and become disciplined sportswomen.
Volleyball is a sport I would definitely encourage everyone to try out,
who knows you may discover new valuable friendships, essential skills,
and unlock a more confident, resilient you!” – <em>Kaylyn Loo, 2C 2025.</em>

<p><em>To all the Primary 6 students thinking about joining the volleyball team, my advice is: just go for it! Enjoy your four years here because time passes very quickly. You’ll discover your own potential here.” – Masami Liao, 2A 2026, DSA Student.</em>

<p>“<em>I have learnt valuable lessons such as to receive criticism to improve and to have resilience. Ever since I joined a sports CCA,I have learnt how to work with different people, and to always dare to try new things. Through volleyball, I learnt that little progress is better than no progress at all, and failure gives you an opportunity to grow. Junyuan and the CCA environment is lively, and we all do our best to uplift each other.”</em> – <em>Wong Jing En, 2E 2026, Lower Sec Vice-Captain.</em>
