<p>“My experience in JY volleyball has been incredibly rewarding. From learning
the fundamental and teamwork skills of volleyball, I’ve also learned valuable
skills such as effective communication with my teammates on court, discipline,
and perseverance. These skills have changed my attitude and mindset, which
are beneficial in both on court training and other areas of life.</p>
<p>If you’re new to volleyball, you should definitely give it a try! I was
also new to volleyball when I first joined the CCA and I found it very
engaging. It can help you to develop self-confidence while learning volleyball,
teamwork and mindset skills. Plus, it’s a great way to create new friendships
among your teammates and long-lasting memories⭐️!!” <em>– Nur Sabrina, Lower Sec Captain 2024.</em>

<p>“I chose to join volleyball to challenge myself, expose myself to different
things and to build new friendships through it. During the CCA trials,
I was drawn to volleyball's fast-paced and dynamic nature, and also the
team's welcoming atmosphere. Volleyball in Junyuan has changed me, not
just physically, but also mentally and emotionally. I've learnt many skills
such as serving, setting, receiving and spiking. More importantly, I've
learnt discipline and perseverance through every training, changing my
perspective of volleyball. My favourite thing about training is the bonding
with my teammates. Overcoming challenges and achieving small victories
together increases our team spirit and teamwork together. It is not about
winning, but it is about encouraging one another by cheering saying "it's
okay" and "you can do it!". This CCA has really made an impact on my life
as it made me realise how important having confidence in yourself was.</p>
<p>Volleyball is a fun, dynamic and social sport which anyone can try out!
It enhances our mental toughness as we grow and become disciplined sportswomen.
Volleyball is a sport I would definitely encourage everyone to try out,
who knows you may discover new valuable friendships, essential skills,
and unlock a more confident, resilient you!” – <em>Kaylyn Loo, 1C 2024.</em>

<p>“Being in Junyuan Volleyball has made me realize the importance of sportsmanship
and hard work. I was in a performing arts in primary school, so I had no
experience or foundation in a sports-related CCA. After joining, I faced
multiple difficulties, including challenges with stamina, and stepping
out of my comfort zone. I was shy and kept everything to myself. However,
thanks to the guidance and support from my coach, teachers-in-charge, and
teammates, I gradually became more comfortable during training. Volleyball
began to feel like a family to me.</p>
<p>My most memorable experience in Junyuan Volleyball was during my C-Division
competition in 2023, when I was in Secondary 2. Through that competition,
I came to understand the importance of having the right Coach, Teachers,
and team members! The team talks after every competition not only brought
my team and me closer but also helped us recognize our strengths and areas
for improvement. This experience truly enhanced the team spirit.” – <em>Ling Jia Min, 4D, Upper Secondary Captain 2025</em>.</p>

<p>When I first joined the team, I was quite shy to approach anyone, but
with the help of welcoming teachers, and teammates, I quickly settled in!
One of my most memorable moments here in Junyuan Volleyball would be attending
the Mintonette Cup in June 2023. The Cup was one of my first competitions
I participated, and it helped me gain experience of what it’s really like
to participate in a high-pressure environment. That day, I learned that
volleyball is all about teamwork, where each player’s role is essential,
and that communication and trust are key to keeping the game flowing smoothly.
Overall, being in Junyuan Volleyball helped me to work on my resilience
and self-confidence. Whenever I faced setbacks, I learnt that it’s important
to maintain a positive attitude throughout the game and to encourage myself
and others to do the same, practicing this helped me with my personal growth.
While many might think volleyball is just about hitting a ball, I learnt
that it is more than just that!” – <em>Ysabelle, 4D, Upper Sec Vice-Captain</em>
