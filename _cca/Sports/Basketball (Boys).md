<p>Basketball Club members will be able to learn a range of ball handling
techniques, coupled with shooting moves and drills. Under the guidance
of our experienced coach, members will be exposed to a wide range of offensive
and defensive strategies. In additional, members will also be coached and
train on positional plays to enhance their understanding of the game, as
well as to level up their individual competencies.</p>
<p>The court and rules do not make the game, the player does. Basketball
is essentially about developing and nurturing the sportsmanship and character
of the player. Through our programme, we hope to develop:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>An effective team player who values the importance of collaboration and
team spirit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An resilient team player who is able perform to the best of his ability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A responsible team player who brings out the best in not only himself,
but also his team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motto:<br></strong>United We Stand - Our members are the important
building blocks of our CCA. Each of us have something to contribute, and
our part to play. As we grow and develop, we become stronger and so does
our CCA.</p>

<p>The tournament allowed our basketball boys the opportunity to play against
other zone schools in a competitive platform. The boys trained hard prior
to the competition, and they gave their all for each and every game that
they played. They fought for each ball and gave their best to make Junyuan
proud. They carried themselves well and showed much perseverance and focus.
They remembered their CCA motto – United We Stand. Every Basketball boy
who competed came back a winner!</p>
