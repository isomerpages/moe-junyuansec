<p>Rugby is a gentleman sport, and JYSS Rugby strives to imbue that spirit in all of our players and foster players who play with pride and honour.&nbsp;We also want them to improve fitness while developing social skills like tolerance, leadership, concentration, determination, teamwork &ndash; and, of course, how to deal graciously with success or defeat.</p>
<p>Apart from picking up rugby skills such as tackling, catching and passing, they also keep fit and train their stamina through weekly gym sessions. In JYSS Rugby, we strive to constantly hone our skills and grow to become better athletes. We also expect all our players to demonstrate commitment, responsibility and discipline.</p>

<p>Our teachers are the pillars of the CCA who help to further develop the strengths of our boys in order to help them achieve our full potential. They support the boys through hardships and challenges, watching them grow as rugby players.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"Education is important, rugby is important-er."&nbsp;<br />-&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Alsagoff</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">"We hope that the boys can learn the values of care, resilience and responsibility through the CCA."<br />-&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Seah</p>
