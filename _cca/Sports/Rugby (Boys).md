<p>Rugby is a gentleman sport, and JYSS Rugby strives to imbue that spirit
in all of our players and foster players who play with pride and honour.&nbsp;We
also want them to improve fitness while developing social skills like tolerance,
leadership, concentration, determination, teamwork – and, of course, how
to deal graciously with success or defeat.</p>
<p>Apart from picking up rugby skills such as tackling, catching and passing,
they also keep fit and train their stamina through weekly gym sessions.
In JYSS Rugby, we strive to constantly hone our skills and grow to become
better athletes. We also expect all our players to demonstrate commitment,
responsibility and discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Motto<br></strong>Play hard with heart</p>

<p><strong>Our Journey</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Our National School Games’ Journey</strong>
</p>
<p>Our teachers are the pillars of the CCA, guiding our boys to develop their
strengths and reach their full potential. They support the boys through
hardships and challenges, watching them grow as rugby players. In 2023,
the JY Rugby Boys made history by reaching the finals of the National School
Games Bowl Championship at the Singapore Sports Hub for the first time.
Demonstrating unwavering grit and determination, they repeated this remarkable
achievement in both 2024 and 2025.</p>
