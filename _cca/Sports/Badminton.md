<p>The Badminton CCA is a CCA where you will not only be taught how to play
in matches, as well as handle both your racket and the shuttle, but you
will also be taught important values such as perseverance and dedication.
Badminton is a sport that requires you to be able to persevere through
matches and dedicate much of your time to the vigorous training sessions
that the coaches have planned as well as your own physical training. Under
the guidance of the coaches, you will be able to learn skills such as footwork,
stamina training, muscle strengthening, how to play in matches, how to
umpire matches, and how to hit the shuttle accurately across to the other
side of the court.</p>
<p>Essentially, badminton is a game of respect towards both the players and
the court itself. When you play, don’t just play to win. Play and enjoy
yourself while picking up new skills from your opponent. The game itself
teaches you to respect others and dedicate time to train for it. Perseverance
is required during the actual game as your opponents vary in skillset and
you do not always get an easy opponent. Through our CCA we hope to build
players of character and not just players with excellent skills.</p>
