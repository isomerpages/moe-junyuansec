<p><em>Guitar in our Hands, Music in our Hearts</em>
</p>
<p>Our Guitar Ensemble aims to nurture accomplished guitarists who take pride
in their craft. Playing as a cohesive ensemble, our members engage in the
art of guitar performance, mastering both classical compositions and modern
pop arrangements with precision and passion. Students in our ensemble have
ample opportunities to participate in competitions, perform in public and
attend concerts, enriching their musical experience and growth.</p>
<p>In Guitar Ensemble, students build a strong foundation in essential guitar
skills including chord reading, note recognition and rhythm. Working collaboratively,
members develop ensemble skills, focusing on tone, dynamics, and musical
expression to achieve a unified sound. Through a diverse repertoire that
spans classical and contemporary music, students are exposed to a variety
of musical styles, broadening their appreciation and skill.</p>
<p>Our ensemble seeks to instill confidence in each student by offering performance
opportunities within the school and in the broader community. While we
strive for excellence in events such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF),
our primary focus remains on fostering a genuine joy for music in both
competitive and non-competitive settings. Through Guitar Ensemble, students
gain not only technical expertise but also a deep appreciation for the
power of music and teamwork.</p>

<p><strong>Our Journey</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I love being in Guitar CCA as it has taught me various skills such as reading chords as well as guitar fingering. Above all, I feel at ease when I play the guitar as it allows me to express myself. Being a Logistic IC has also developed my leadership skills. I feel blessed being in Guitar Ensemble as it is very fun!”</em>
</p>
<p>–Nurul Haziqah Binte Kamsan (Alumni)</p>
<p><em>“As someone who has zero knowledge on guitar and scores, being in Guitar Ensemble has allowed me to learn many new things that I have not encountered such as reading the guitar scores, playing some music from the instrument itself and knowing the basics of guitar. For the past 3-4 years, I have grown to love this CCA as there are so many wonderful people around. Its the teachers in charge, Mr Eugene Lee, and my fellow mates and close friends I made in this CCA who made Guitar Ensemble more fun and interesting. Guitar is useful to me because it is another talent added in the list as I am someone who think that I have no talent. I think it has helped me to love music more and has given me the chance to play songs that I love. You might even meet lifetime bestfriends here in the CCA just like me!”</em>
</p>
<p>– Koh Jie Ying (Alumni)</p>
<p><em>“I love to learn more about music through classical guitar. Someone once told me that the Guitar provides an orchestral setting similar to that of no other instrument, and I truly believe in this. Playing the Guitar gives me a very unique and pure form of joy in my life. The strong emphasis on the value of leadership skills learnt during my secondary school days have also helped me to become the President of SMU Guitarissimo and aided me greatly in the day-to-day running of the club. I believe in sharing more about the Guitar and instilling the belief in others that leaders are not born, but shaped when growing up. This is why I have decided to help at my alma mater, to inspire juniors to lead well and to continue pursuing their passion in Guitar.”</em>
