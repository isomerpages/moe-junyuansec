After I joined band, I learnt how to play instruments and under the tutelage of the instructors and helpful seniors, we are able to learn a variety of theories, techniques in playing the instrument and values such as resilience.</p><p>Our CCA motto is, One Band, One Sound. That means we play and learn together as one band. Despite being split into different sections we are able to work together, as we believe that every person in the band counts. Even though we practice in separate rooms due to Covid-19 measures, we manage to learn together by helping each other out in times when we are having difficulties. This experience taught us how to persevere through the hard times, be more resilient and how to be a good team player.</p><p>My CCA helped me grow more as a person as it taught me to be more inclusive of others while working with then. With the help of my band seniors, I have been more active and motivated as a person. Thus I enjoy being in band." - Teo Eu Chia, Band Major (2018</p><p>“I guess what makes me enjoy band was the process of preparing for performances, something like when we were practicing together for soirée.
