<p><strong>Join Our Band: A Journey into the World of Music</strong>
</p>
<p>Our band offers a unique opportunity for individuals to learn how to read
music and play instruments, regardless of prior musical experience. With
the guidance of our experienced and qualified instructors, you'll be equipped
with the skills you need to progress quickly. Additionally, our senior
band members will serve as mentors, supporting you as you embark on this
enriching, empowering, and enjoyable musical journey.</p>
<p>As a band member, you will not only develop musical proficiency but also
grow as a person. You will become more confident, adaptable, and resilient
as you explore various musical styles and genres. Practicing individually
during sectionals or at home will foster self-discipline and independence,
making you a self-directed learner. When you come together with the band,
you will enhance your ability to work as part of a team, contributing to
the collective sound and experience of the group.</p>
<p>Each band member plays a crucial role in the ensemble, no matter how small
their part. Every contribution is vital to the success of our performances,
reinforcing the importance of personal responsibility and commitment to
the group.</p>
<p>Our practice sessions also emphasize mentorship and peer coaching, creating
a collaborative environment where members actively support and uplift one
another. These interactions foster teamwork, encourage personal growth,
and cultivate a strong sense of ownership and responsibility within the
band.</p>
<p>Join us and become part of a vibrant community where music brings people
together, develops character, and inspires excellence!</p>

<p>"I chose band because I am interested in music and I wanted to try out
what it would be like to join a symphonic band. After I joined band, I
learnt how to play instruments and under the tutelage of the instructors
and helpful seniors, we are able to learn a variety of theories, techniques
in playing the instrument and values such as resilience.</p>
<p>Our CCA motto is, One Band, One Sound. That means we play and learn together
as one band. Despite being split into different sections we are able to
work together, as we believe that every person in the band counts. Even
though we practice in separate rooms due to Covid-19 measures, we manage
to learn together by helping each other out in times when we are having
difficulties. This experience taught us how to persevere through the hard
times, be more resilient and how to be a good team player.</p>
<p>My CCA helped me grow more as a person as it taught me to be more inclusive
of others while working with then. With the help of my band seniors, I
have been more active and motivated as a person. Thus I enjoy being in
band." - Teo Eu Chia, Band Major (2018</p>
<p>“I guess what makes me enjoy band was the process of preparing for performances,
something like when we were practicing together for soirée. I also really
liked it when we were able to play songs that we chose.” - Wong Xin Hui
(3E2, 2021)</p>
<p>“I like how in band we are all united together despite our differences
and we are able to help and support each other.” - Avril Lee 3E4 2020</p>
<p>“I like the people who help us juniors learn and help us in all our needs.”
- Ryan Poh 2N1 2020</p>
<p>“It is fun because I think it’s the fact that i get to play music and
it makes me feel very happy when we get to finish playing a piece together.”
- Maegan Tan, Drum Major 2019</p>
