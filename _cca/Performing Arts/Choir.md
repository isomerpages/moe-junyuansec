<div style="text-align: center;"><em>"I hope students will have integrity in them, because we are constantly working on our legacy and creating a reputation for ourselves everyday. What we do now sets up our future and people's perception of our honesty. And this honesty should be formed within, even if no one is watching." - Ms Rachael Teo</em></div>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>"I think singing in a choir brings a lot of benefits not many people are aware of. Thus this CCA tends to be less popular than other performing arts in the school. One such benefit is that singing a chorus can instantly relief stress and promote friendship; and when you get to harmonise vocally, you see the beauty of music" - Mdm Nadiah Khamis</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Our CCA Experiences (through challenging times)</strong></p>

<p><em>"As a CCA, Choir is not just about singing as one big group, but a cca that enables us to grow more as an individual, be more confident in yourself and most importantly to learn how to converse with others as a group while have fun.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;As a choir, we have attended many activities together outside of school. For example, our first ever Soiree performance in 2018, the SYF performance, and also to be having choir exchanges with other schools. We also attended other concerts such as the concert by Raffles Chorale which included other international choirs from around the world.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>As a CCA, Choir allows us to build up our skills of conversing to our audience through the language of music, using our melodious voices. No one will be left behind despite the struggles you face as an individual as our motto is "Every heart sings a song". This means that each and every one of us plays an important role in our cca when it comes to singing together. Not only that, choir also allows us to gain more confidence in ourselves when it comes to having to perform in front of a huge crowd of people be it in school or elsewhere in the public."</em></p>

<p>"The choir is bonded and united. During our breaks, we will usually have the chance to converse with each other because choir is like my second family. Practices are very enjoyable as well because we get to sing a lot, this is really helps me express my feelings."</p>

<p>&ldquo;I joined Choir because of my passion for music. I was willing to learn, and Choir has given me the opportunities to develop leadership qualities. We performed in concerts during Chinese New Year and National Day. We also attended external choir performances. From all these experiences, I have benefitted greatly and have grown to be a confident leader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Choir is more than just a CCA. We fostered strong bonds over the years and had grown together as a big family. By contributing to various events, Choir allows me to build my confidence, develop a sense of belonging to the school and brought me to where I am today.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Choir has instilled in me values such as responsibility and teamwork. Working and performing together with the Choir had helped me overcome my stage fright. We help one another and have grown to became united. We feel comfortable relating to each other. To me, Choir is not just about singing. I learnt to be a better person as I developed good values and learn new skills.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">- Jannah Nicole Pama Ramos, 3E3, Section Leader 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choir is fun and interesting. It helped me grow into a confident individual. I took part in Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), where all our voices came together singing beautiful songs. We worked well together as all my Choir members were kind, helpful and friendly. I am proud to represent Junyuan Choir.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">- Rachel Tan Jia Xuan, 3E3, Section Leader 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;Choir has a special place in my heart because of the many wonderful memories I have made with my Choir members. It unleashed our talents as we come together to express ourselves in singing melodious songs. We all worked well to showcase the song &lsquo;Fried Rice Paradise&rsquo; during the CCA promotion day. Choir is a special CCA as it brings together voices of every member to a dulcet tone which tells a story.&rdquo;</p>
