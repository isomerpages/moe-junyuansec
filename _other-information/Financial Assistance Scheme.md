ComCare beneficiaries no longer need to submit a separate MOE FAS application
form to the school as their children will be automatically granted MOE
FAS, with effect from the month following the approval of their ComCare
assistance.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interested applicants
have to submit their duly completed application forms with supporting documents
