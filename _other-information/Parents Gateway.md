<h4><strong>Welcome aboard!</strong></h4>
<p>Parents Gateway is a mobile app specially designed for parents. Developed by MOE and GovTech, the app allows parents to engage closely with schools, receive information and perform a range of administrative functions including giving consent for school trips.</p>
<p>Junyuan Secondary School has been selected as an Early Adopter of Parents Gateway. This means that parents of our school will get to start using the mobile app first! We would like to invite you to download the free Parents Gateway mobile app on your mobile phone (available on iOS and Android platforms only) and perform a simple one-time onboarding process. Refer to the link below for a step-by-step guide.</p>
